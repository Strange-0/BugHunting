# BugHunting
Welcome to my Bug Hunting Reports Repository! üêõüîç

This repository serves as a platform for me, a beginner in the bug hunting field, to share and document my bug hunting reports. Here, I'll be posting reports on various vulnerabilities I discover, learnings from my experiences, and my overall progress in this exciting journey.

Please note that all real names and sensitive information have been removed or anonymized to prioritize security and privacy. The primary objective of this repository is to foster learning, collaboration, and improvement in bug hunting skills.

Happy Learning! üêûüíª
